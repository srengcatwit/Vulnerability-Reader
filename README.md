# Vulnerability Reader

Vulnerability Reader is a cybersecurity tool designed to read and filter CSV files containing vulnerability data. It provides users with the ability to efficiently search for specific vulnerabilities based on customizable filters, such as name, severity, CVSS score, EPSS score, age (days), published date, first detected date, and more.

## Software Components

### Front-end: Chom’s Role
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Tkinter
- **Description:** Tkinter is used to create a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for uploading CSV files and applying filters.

### Back-end: Nhat’s Role
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for CSV file handling and data manipulation.
  - `tkinter` for creating GUI components.
- **Description:** The backend handles reading CSV files, validating data, applying filters, and processing the results.
